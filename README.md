# Swanand Inventory Management System

The **Swanand Inventory Management System** is a web application built with Django for managing inventory, stock transfers, transaction logs, and other related tasks. This system aims to help businesses maintain real-time stock data, perform stock transfers, and track transactions with ease.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**: Manage and track company products, their quantities, costs, and locations.
- **Stock Transfers**: Record and manage stock transfers between different locations.
- **Transaction Logs**: View and filter detailed transaction records for stock entries and transfers.
- **Export Options**: Export transaction logs and stock entries in various formats like CSV, Excel, and PDF.
- **Dark Mode**: A dark mode theme for a better user experience during night-time usage.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is responsive, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x+
- Database: SQLite (default) or any other database configured in Django settings.
- (Optional) Additional dependencies based on the export functionality (e.g., `pandas` for Excel/CSV export, `reportlab` for PDF export).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Jenil7828/Swanand-inventory-management.git
cd Swanand-inventory-management


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:


python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
- For **Windows**:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
- For **Mac/Linux**:
    source venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies using `pip`:

pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Apply Migrations
Run migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser (Optional)
If you want to access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser

Follow the prompts to create the user.

### 6. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

You can access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
